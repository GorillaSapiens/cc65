The cc65 cross-compiler suite
=============================

cc65 is a complete cross-development package for 65(C)02 systems,
including a powerful macro assembler, a C compiler, linker, archiver,
simulator and several other tools.  cc65 has C and runtime library
support for many of the old 6502 machines.
